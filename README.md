## Information

This is the free implementation of the BrainFuck programming language written in C. The interpreter support two execution mode:

* source files (*.bf) execution mode;
* interactive execution mode.  

To run the first mode you need to pass the path to source file to the interpreter. For example:

```bush
./bfi hello_world.bf
```

Or you can run the interactive mode by the command without parameters:

```bash
./bfi
```
